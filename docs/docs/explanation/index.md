# Explanation

Explanation documentation is **understanding-oriented**. It provides background, context, and discusses topics to deepen your understanding of graph concepts and when to apply them.

## Available Topics

### Concepts

- [Graph Concepts](./graph-concepts) - Nodes, edges, directed vs undirected, weighted graphs
- [Centrality Metrics](./centrality-metrics) - Understanding PageRank, betweenness, and more
- [When to Use grph](./when-to-use-grph) - Real-world applications and use cases

### Context

These articles help you understand the "why" behind graph analysis:

- Why does direction matter in graphs?
- When should you use PageRank vs degree centrality?
- What problems is graph analysis good at solving?
